# Final Year Project

This repository contains the software created to produce the results seen in the MEng Final Year Project with title: **"Data Analysis with Mixed-Integer Optimisation for Scheduling Royal Mail Deliveries"**. The report was the main delivarable for this capstone project for my Electronic and Information Engineering degree from Imperial College London. The presentation was the second big deliverable that acted as a supporting document to the report.

## Presentation

## System Specifications

All computations are processed with a 6-core Intel Core i7 CPU running at 2.60GHz with a 16GB RAM memory on a macOS Catalina (version 10.15.4) machine. The models were implemented using C++11 that was compiled with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The solutions were obtained through using the commerical solver CPLEX 12.9. Unless it is specifically stated, all solutions obtained are the optimal ones for the given objective function, set of constraints and decision variables.
